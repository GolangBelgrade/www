This first talk will be 100% introductory, we are aware that Go isn't that much popularized around here, so we want to pitch it to new people. Talk will cover the basics, most prominent language features, what is it's approach philosophy and how it compares to other popular languages. We will also talk about it's uses, what it's good at, as well as what it's bad at. We will show some code samples and have an open discussion afterwards including some beers.

Few things about speaker: [Dusan Lilic](https://github.com/kortemy), last year's Gopher Gala finalist. He is a seasoned web developer with wide array of technologies under his belt.
